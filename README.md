# RehearseUs
RehearseUs is a rehearsal planner web-app that allows members of a group requiring rehearsals (e.g. band, drama club) to manage their rehearsals. It allows the group leader to plan rehearsal events, notify their members, take attendance, and provide any other information on the performance. This project is still currently in development.
